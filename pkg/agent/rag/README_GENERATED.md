# agent_test

This package contains tests for the agent module, which is responsible for handling semantic search and conversation management.

## File structure
- agent.go
- semantic_search_test.go
- superagent.go
- tools/tools.go
- pkg/rag/agent/semantic_search_test.go

## Code summary
The package contains several test functions that cover different aspects of the agent module's functionality.

- `Test_Search`: This test function checks the basic functionality of the OneShotRun function, which is responsible for performing a one-shot search using a given LLM model and query.
- `TestMemory`: This test function tests the agent's ability to maintain conversation memory by running the OneShotRun function multiple times with the same LLM model and updating the initial state after each run.
- `TestLongConversation`: This test function checks the agent's ability to handle long conversations by running the OneShotRun function multiple times with the same LLM model and updating the initial state after each run.
- `Test5Conversation`: This test function tests the agent's ability to handle conversations with multiple turns by running the OneShotRun function five times with the same LLM model and updating the initial state after each run.
- `createGenericLLM`: This helper function creates a generic LLM model with the specified parameters, which is used in the other test functions.

The tests cover various scenarios, including one-shot search, conversation memory, long conversations, and multi-turn conversations. They ensure that the agent module functions correctly and can handle different types of interactions.

## Edge cases
The tests cover various edge cases, such as long conversations and multi-turn conversations, to ensure the agent module can handle different types of interactions.

## Unclear places
The code does not explicitly mention how the agent module handles errors or exceptions during the conversation process. It would be beneficial to have tests that cover these scenarios to ensure the agent module is robust and can handle unexpected situations.

## Dead code
There is no apparent dead code in the provided code.
