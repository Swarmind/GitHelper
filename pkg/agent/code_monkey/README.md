## Code Entities and Relations

The package defines a graph data structure to represent dependencies between code elements. The `Toolchain` struct manages a set of tools and their configurations. The `Solver` interface provides an abstraction for solving planning problems, and the `Planner` struct implements this interface using an LLM-based approach. The `Executor` struct is responsible for executing the generated code.

The `Planner` struct interacts with the `LLMContext` to generate a plan for a given task. The `LLMContext` is responsible for loading environment variables, initializing an OpenAI LLM, and retrieving a list of tools. The `GetPlan` function of the `LLMContext` is tested in the `TestPlanner` function.

## Edge Cases

The application can be launched by running the `main` function in the `executor.go` file.

## Unclear Places

The specific implementation details of the `Solver` interface and the `Executor` struct are not provided in the given code.
