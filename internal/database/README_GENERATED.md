## Package: database

Imports:
- "database/sql"
- "_ "github.com/lib/pq"
- "errors"
- "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"

External data, input sources:
- The code interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve chat history.

TODOs:
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.

Summary:
- The database package provides a Handler struct that manages a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The NewHandler function takes a connection string as input and returns a new Handler instance. The Handler struct has a DB field that stores the database connection.
- The code uses the "database/sql" package to interact with the database and the "github.com/lib/pq" package to provide a PostgreSQL driver. The connection string is used to establish a connection to the database, and the Handler struct is used to manage the connection.
- The Handler struct can be used to execute SQL queries and perform other database operations.
- The code defines a structure for storing chat session history, including the conversation buffer and the dialog thread.
- It provides functions to check if a collection exists, create tables for storing chat history, get chat history for a given issue, drop chat history, and update chat history.
- The code uses the llms package to handle message content and interacts with the database to store and retrieve chat history.
- The code is designed to work with the langchaingo package, which is a Go implementation of the LangChain framework for building applications powered by large language models.

File structure:
- db.go
- db_test.go
- init.go
- service.go

Relations between code entities:
- The Handler struct in the init.go file is used by the Service struct in the service.go file to manage the database connection.
- The Service struct uses the Handler struct to interact with the database and perform operations such as creating tables, getting chat history, and updating chat history.

Unclear places:
- The code does not provide any specific examples of how to use the Handler struct, but it can be assumed that it would be used to interact with the database in a typical application.
- The CreateTables method is not shown in the provided code, but it is assumed to be part of the Service struct.
